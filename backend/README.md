# Backend Application

This README file provides an overview of the backend application for the three-tier web application project.

## Overview

The backend application is built using Node.js and Express. It serves as the server-side component of the three-tier architecture, handling requests from the frontend, processing data, and interacting with the storage layer.

## Project Structure

The backend application has the following structure:

```
backend/
├── src/
│   ├── app.ts               # Entry point of the application
│   ├── controllers/         # Contains request handling logic
│   │   └── index.ts         # Main controller
│   ├── routes/              # Defines application routes
│   │   └── index.ts         # Route definitions
│   └── models/              # Data models
│       └── index.ts         # Main model definitions
├── package.json              # Project metadata and dependencies
├── tsconfig.json             # TypeScript configuration
└── README.md                 # Documentation for the backend
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd three-tier-web-app/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, it will listen for incoming requests on the specified port (default is 3000). You can interact with the API using tools like Postman or cURL.
