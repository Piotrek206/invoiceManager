# Storage Component

The storage component of the three-tier web application is responsible for managing the database schema and interactions with the database. This component ensures that data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated efficiently.

## Directory Structure

- **schema/**: Contains the SQL schema files that define the structure of the database tables and their relationships.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Database Setup**: 
   - Ensure that you have a compatible database server installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   - Create a new database for the application.

2. **Schema Initialization**:
   - Navigate to the `schema` directory.
   - Execute the SQL script in `schema.sql` to set up the necessary tables and relationships in your database.

3. **Configuration**:
   - Update the database connection settings in the backend application to point to your newly created database.

## Usage

The storage component works in conjunction with the backend application to handle data operations. Ensure that the backend is properly configured to interact with the database defined by the schema.

For further details on how to interact with the database through the backend, refer to the backend documentation.
